# Project Idea Title: Save A Spot

## Summary of the Project Idea

Save My Spot is a parking lot software that runs on a web-based automation system which makes securing parking space for motorists easier. This system is developed for motorists who need parking spaces in Nairobi at the Central Business District.

The current most widely used parking lot system is managed by the Nairobi City Council. This system uses a more traditional and labour-intensive approach in allocating parking spaces. Representatives from the Nairobi City Council position themselves around various spots in the CBD whereby motorist pay a fee to gain parking access within the CBD for a day.

This brings a problem as even though motorists get parking access after paying a fee, they are not guaranteed to get a free space at a parking lot of their convenience. In addition to this, the government has to hire more representatives from the City Council to ensure that every car that is parked has paid their due fees.

_The Parking Lot System solves this problem by_:

1. Providing information to its users on available parking spaces within the CBD.

2. Allowing its users to book a space in advance.

3. Reducing the labour cost and manual work that is in the existing system by automating the ticketing process.
