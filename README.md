# Project Idea Title: Save A Spot

## Summary of the Project Idea

Parking in the CBD is a major economic drawback to the economy of Kenya in terms of productivity which leads to loss of thousands of manhours. The existing system is managed by the Nairobi City Council. This system uses a more traditional and labour-intensive approach in allocating parking spaces. Representatives from the Nairobi County Council Government position themselves around various spots in the CBD whereby motorist pay a fee to gain parking access within the CBD for a day. This brings a problem as even though motorists get parking access after paying a fee, they are not guaranteed to get a free space at a parking lot of their convenience. In addition to this, the government has to hire more representatives from the County Council Government to ensure that every car that is parked has paid their due fees.

Save A Spot presents an opportunity for motorists to conveniently secure a parking space within the Central Business District. With just a few clicks, a user can retrieve information about free spaces available, price of the allocated space and their booking information all through the internet.
