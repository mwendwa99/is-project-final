# Project Idea Title: Save My Spot

## Summary of the Project Idea

Save My Spot is a parking lot software that runs on a web-based automation system which makes securing parking space for motorists easier. This system is developed for motorists who need parking spaces in Nairobi at the Central Business District.

The current most widely used parking lot system is managed by the Nairobi City Council. This system uses a more traditional and labour-intensive approach in allocating parking spaces. Representatives from the Nairobi City Council position themselves around various spots in the CBD whereby motorist pay a fee to gain parking access within the CBD for a day.

This brings a problem as even though motorists get parking access after paying a fee, they are not guaranteed to get a free space at a parking lot of their convenience. In addition to this, the government has to hire more representatives from the City Council to ensure that every car that is parked has paid their due fees.

_The Parking Lot System solves this problem by_:

1. Providing information to its users on available parking spaces within the CBD.

2. Allowing its users to book a space in advance.

3. Reducing the labour cost and manual work that is in the existing system by automating the ticketing process.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
